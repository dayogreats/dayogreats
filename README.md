- 👋 Hi, I’m @dayogreats
- 👀 I am a self-starter and an ambitious person driven by a curiosity for knowledge to continually deliver values in whatever i do. 
- 💞️ I sincerely love science and technologies, products, people and policy it produces; it is just a matter of time, I will check it out!
- ✨ I see possibility in small things and I celebrate success whether it is mine or others. I take responsibility and I am comfortable working in a team, learning from others, and importantly, I do not give up.
- 🌱 I believe in the power and efficacy of ideas. Above all, solving problems gets me excited even when I do not have a solution yet but getting the job done is a major encouragement and fulfillment.

- 📫 How to reach me? holla @dayogreats!
